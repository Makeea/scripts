### 🌍 Update Linux Across Multiple Distros

This universal update script detects your Linux distribution and uses the native package manager automatically.

📄 **Script link:**  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Makeea/scripts/master/linux/linux-update-universal.sh

▶️ **Run it:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Makeea/scripts/master/linux/linux-update-universal.sh | sudo bash
```

**What it does:**

- Detects the distro from `/etc/os-release`
- Detects Proxmox VE hosts and handles them safely
- Supports `apt`, `dnf`, `yum`, `pacman`, and `zypper`
- Runs updates and cleanup commands for the detected package manager
- Writes logs to `/var/log/linux-update-universal.log`
- Prevents overlapping runs with a lock file
- Reboots automatically after a successful update on non-Proxmox systems

**Good to know:**

- Run it with `sudo` or as root
- It does not perform major OS version upgrades
- On Proxmox, it does not reboot automatically and will tell you if a reboot is recommended
- Best for routine package updates on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Rocky, AlmaLinux, Arch, Manjaro, openSUSE, and similar systems

2. Replace `<username>` with your GitHub account name:

```bash
ssh-import-id-gh <username>
