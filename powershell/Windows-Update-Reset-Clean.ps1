# Windows 11 Update Reset Script (PowerShell)
# This script will fully reset and clear all Windows Update components
# Run as Administrator
#
# =====================================================================
# DEVELOPMENT NOTES:
# This script was created using "vibe coding" methodology - our first
# attempt at collaborative iterative development between human and AI.
# The process involved multiple iterations, debugging, and refinements
# to create a comprehensive Windows Update reset solution.
#
# VIBE CODING ANALYSIS:
# While vibe coding allowed for creative collaboration, it highlighted
# several significant issues with this development approach:
#
# PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:
# - Persistent syntax errors across multiple iterations
# - Malformed try-catch blocks and missing braces
# - Functions with incorrect parameter declarations
# - Copy-paste errors when transferring between versions
# - Redundant features (IE reset, troubleshooter) not caught initially
# - Multiple "complete rewrites" needed due to syntax issues
# - Time-consuming debugging cycles that proper planning could avoid
#
# WHY VIBE CODING IS PROBLEMATIC:
# 1. LACK OF UPFRONT PLANNING - No architectural design before coding
# 2. SYNTAX INCONSISTENCY - Multiple format attempts without validation
# 3. FEATURE CREEP - Adding components without considering necessity
# 4. DEBUGGING OVERHEAD - More time spent fixing than building
# 5. VERSION CONFUSION - Multiple broken versions causing user errors
# 6. INCOMPLETE TESTING - Syntax errors not caught before delivery
# 7. ITERATIVE WASTE - Repeated work due to poor initial structure
#
# LESSONS LEARNED:
# - Proper syntax validation should occur before each iteration
# - Feature requirements should be defined upfront
# - Code architecture should be planned before implementation
# - Each version should be tested before presenting to user
# - Redundant features should be identified during design phase
#
# RECOMMENDATION: While vibe coding enables creative collaboration,
# traditional structured development with proper planning, testing,
# and validation would have prevented most issues encountered.
# =====================================================================
#
# CHANGELOG:
# v1.0 - Initial PowerShell version with basic functionality
# v1.1 - Added comprehensive DLL registration and detailed comments
# v1.2 - Converted from batch script with enhanced error handling
# v1.3 - Fixed syntax errors: missing braces and malformed try-catch blocks
# v1.4 - Complete rewrite to resolve persistent parsing errors
# v1.5 - Added development methodology notes and comprehensive changelog
# v1.6 - Minimal clean version to resolve persistent syntax issues

# Check if running as administrator
